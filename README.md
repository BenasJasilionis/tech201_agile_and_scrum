## What is Agile?
Agile is a software development philosophy which focuses on iterative releases of software and increased communication between all parties involved (developers, operators, business analyst).

The Agile manifesto consists of 4 values:
* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
* Working software over comprehensive documentation
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
* Responding to change over following a plan

Agile can be broken down in more detail by looking at the 12 principles:
1) Highest priority is to satisfy customers through early and continuous delivery of valuable software
2) Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customers competitive advantage
3) Deliver working software frequently, every couple weeks to months, with a preference for shorter time scales
4) Business people and developers must work together on projects
5) Build projects around motivated individuals - give the environment and support needed and trust them to get the job done
6) Most effective way to convey information is face-to-face
7) Working software is the primary measure of progress
8) Sustainable development should mean that sponsors, developers and users can maintain pace indefinitely
9) Continuous attention to technical excellence and design
10) Simplicity is key -> maximise amount of work not done
11) Best architectures, requirements and designs emerge from self- organising teams
12) At regular intervals -> reflect on how to be more effective, then tune and adjust behaviour accordingly
